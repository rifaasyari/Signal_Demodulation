# Signal_Demodulation
Uploaded Matlab Code that can be used to demodulate optic signals to extract the original information contained in the signals. The uploaded code shows the example of using a fiber optic strain sensor being demodulated to provide useful information from light intensity measurements.

A detailed logic behind this code can be found here. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o7yeKqx-X7BSXEC98GPmwYXK6PapXo0S/view?usp=sharing)

A summary of the mathematics behind the two methods of demodulation is provided below. First I will talk about using Trignometry to aid our cause of demodulating the intensity signal from the strain sensor.
